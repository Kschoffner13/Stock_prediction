    "## Reason for model change\n",
    "In our project proposal, we initially decided to use the CNN model as one of our models. However, after receiving feedback that a CNN may not be ideal for time-series information, we decided to research other options, and use another RNN-based model, The GRU (greident recurrent unit) model. \n",
    "\n",
    "While both models take into account the relationships between different data points, the main issue with CNN’s is that they are designed to handle spatial patterns better, making them ideal for images, and less so for sequential data such as time-series data. GRU models process data in chronological order (sequential), which is critical for time series data. \n",

    "This notebook implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for stock price prediction using **5 key features** that are easy to understand and explain to stakeholders.\n",
